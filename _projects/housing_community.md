# 🏠 Build Baby Build: The Workers’ Housing Guarantee

## Overview

Housing is more than a roof over our heads—it’s the foundation for opportunity, dignity, and strong communities. Our **Workers’ Housing Guarantee**—rallied under the motto **Build Baby Build**—is about more than just constructing new homes. It’s about revitalizing and modernizing existing buildings, creating **sustainable, affordable housing**, and preserving the character of our neighborhoods. By focusing on **condos, first-time ownership properties**, and energy-efficient redevelopment, we will expand housing opportunities without destroying communities or burdening the environment.
