# Civil Rights and Equality Policy

## Overview

**Civil rights are the foundation of justice, equity, and progress**‚Äîthey must be protected, expanded, and enforced without compromise. In **Georgia's 5th Congressional District**, systemic inequalities continue to harm marginalized communities, limiting opportunities and silencing voices. We are committed to dismantling barriers, combating discrimination, and ensuring **equal rights and protections for all people**, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, income, or background.

We will take bold action to **end systemic injustices, empower underrepresented communities**, and foster a society where everyone can thrive with dignity.
