# **Healthcare for All: A Human Right, Not a Privilege**  

Healthcare in **Georgia’s 5th Congressional District** is in crisis. Families are drowning in medical debt, prescription drug prices are skyrocketing, and too many people can’t afford to see a doctor when they need one. I am fighting for **Medicare for All**—a system where every resident gets **affordable, high-quality healthcare** without financial barriers.  

By eliminating **medical debt, lowering prescription drug prices, and expanding mental health services**, we will ensure that **healthcare serves people, not corporations**. No one should have to choose between rent and life-saving treatment.

- **🏥 Hospitals in underserved areas are closing:** Communities—especially in Black and working-class neighborhoods—are losing access to care.  

**This is unacceptable.** We need bold action now.
