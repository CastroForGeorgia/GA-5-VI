# Criminal Justice Reform: A Safer, Fairer Future for All

## Overview

Our criminal justice system is broken. It disproportionately harms Black, brown, and low-income communities, locks people away for minor offenses, and fails to address the root causes of crime. In **Georgia's 5th Congressional District**, we will fight for a system rooted in **equity, accountability, and opportunity**‚Äîone that reduces incarceration, prioritizes prevention, and builds safer communities where every person can thrive.

## **Why Criminal Justice Reform Matters**

## Injustice by the Numbers

Understanding the current state of our criminal justice system is crucial for driving meaningful reform. Here are some key statistics highlighting the disparities and challenges we face:

- **Racial Disparities in Incarceration**: Black Americans are incarcerated at nearly five times the rate of white Americans nationwide.

- **Georgia's Incarceration Rate**: Georgia has an incarceration rate of 881 per 100,000 people, locking up a higher percentage of its population than any independent democratic country on earth. [oai_citation_attribution:3‚Ä°Prison Policy Initiative](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/profiles/GA.html)

- **Disproportionate Impact on Communities of Color**: In Georgia, incarceration rates are highest for Black residents, reflecting significant racial disparities within the state's criminal justice system.

- **Female Incarceration Growth**: The number of women in Georgia‚Äôs prisons has increased more than sevenfold, from 497 in 1978 to 3,779 in 2017, indicating a rising trend in female incarceration.

- **Recidivism Rates**: Georgia's recidivism reports show three-year felony reconviction rates of inmates released from state prisons, highlighting the challenges in reducing repeat offenses.
