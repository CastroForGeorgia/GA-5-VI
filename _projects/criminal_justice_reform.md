# **Criminal Justice Reform: Justice Through Opportunity**  

## **Our System is Broken—We Must Fix It**  

The criminal justice system in **Georgia’s 5th District** disproportionately harms Black, brown, and low-income communities. It over-polices neighborhoods, locks people away for non-violent offenses, and fails to address the root causes of crime. Instead of rehabilitation and prevention, our system fuels cycles of poverty and incarceration.  

We must **end mass incarceration, transform policing, and invest in opportunity-driven solutions** that build safer, more just communities.

## **The Reality: Why Reform is Urgent**  

- **🚨 Georgia’s Incarceration Crisis**: Georgia imprisons more people per capita than any other democratic nation.  
- **⚖️ Racial Disparities**: Black residents are incarcerated at nearly five times the rate of white residents.  
- **💰 Cash Bail Punishes Poverty**: Low-income individuals remain in jail for minor offenses simply because they can’t afford bail.  
- **🏥 Mental Health Criminalization**: Too many people are jailed instead of getting the **mental health and addiction treatment** they need.  
- **🔄 Recidivism Cycle**: Without rehabilitation, housing, and job opportunities, people leaving prison are set up to fail.  

This **does not** make our communities safer—it makes them more unstable.
