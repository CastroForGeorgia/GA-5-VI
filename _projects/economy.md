# Building an Economy That Works for Everyone

## Overview

In **Georgia's 5th Congressional District**, working families form the backbone of our economy.

### ü§ù **3. Fair Taxation for Sustainable Growth**
We will close loopholes and ensure billionaires and corporations pay their fair share:

  - Prevent tax avoidance through offshore accounts.  
  - Eliminate incentives for companies to replace workers with automation without a plan to retrain or redeploy those employees.

  Fair taxation allows us to reinvest in programs like affordable housing, education, and infrastructure that benefit everyone.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **4. Address Automation‚Äôs Impact on Workers**
Automation can be a tool for progress‚Äîbut not at the cost of workers' livelihoods.

- **Regulate Job-Stealing Automation**:  
  Implement safeguards to ensure **new technologies complement workers**, rather than replace them entirely.

- **Job Training and Career Transition**:  
  - Fund **retraining programs** for workers displaced by automation.  
  - Provide career counseling and resources to help workers secure sustainable, future-ready jobs.
