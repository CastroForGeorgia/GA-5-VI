# **Reproductive Rights: Protecting Freedom, Ensuring Access**  

## **The Fight for Reproductive Freedom**  

Reproductive rights are under attack across the country, and **Georgia‚Äôs 5th Congressional District** is no exception. **Georgia has one of the highest maternal mortality rates** in the nation, and restrictive laws disproportionately harm **Black women, low-income families, and rural communities**.  

We must take bold action to **codify abortion rights, expand reproductive healthcare, and guarantee free birthing services**. No one should be forced to **travel out of state, struggle financially, or suffer from medical neglect** just to get the care they need.  

**Reproductive justice is non-negotiable.** We won‚Äôt back down.
