# Women's Reproductive Rights and Care Policy

## Overview

**Reproductive rights are human rights**‚Äînot privileges to be negotiated or compromised. Yet, across the nation and right here in **Georgia's 5th Congressional District**, these rights face relentless attacks. **Georgia ranks among the highest in maternal mortality rates** and continues to suffer from systemic inequities in healthcare access. This is unacceptable.

We are committed to enacting bold, actionable policies to secure reproductive justice. Every woman should have the freedom to make informed decisions about her body and access comprehensive, affordable reproductive care. **We won‚Äôt back down. We won‚Äôt settle.**

## **Why This Matters**

### üìâ **Georgia's Alarming Maternal Mortality Rate**
- Between 2018‚Äì2021: **33.9 deaths per 100,000 live births** (national average: 32.9)
- 2021: Georgia ranked **2nd highest** in maternal mortality nationwide.

This crisis disproportionately affects **Black women** and women in **low-income communities**‚Äîa clear indication of systemic neglect. **It‚Äôs time for change.**
