## **Why Amnesty Is the Right Path Forward**

### 💡 **A Personal Story**  
My mother’s journey is proof that Amnesty changes lives. She immigrated illegally, driven by hope and determination to give our family a better life. Thanks to the Reagan-era Amnesty program, she secured legal status, became a U.S. citizen, and bought her first home—a milestone that gave us stability and a foundation for success.  

Her story reflects what millions of immigrants can achieve when given a fair chance. Instead of detention camps or deportations, Amnesty provides pathways for hardworking people to contribute, grow, and thrive in our communities.
