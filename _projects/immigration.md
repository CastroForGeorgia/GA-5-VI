# **Immigration Policy: Amnesty and Humane Reform**  

## **A Just and Practical Approach to Immigration**  

America has always been a nation of immigrants, yet our immigration system remains broken—**relying on detention, fear, and bureaucracy instead of solutions that strengthen families and communities**. In **Georgia’s 5th Congressional District**, we believe in an immigration policy built on **Amnesty, opportunity, and integration**, ensuring that hardworking people can contribute to our society **without fear of deportation or family separation**.  

It’s time to **replace detention camps with pathways to citizenship** and **mass deportations with economic inclusion**.

## **Why Amnesty Is the Right Path Forward**  

### 💡 **The Power of Opportunity**  
Millions of undocumented individuals live, work, and contribute to our communities—yet they remain in legal limbo. **Amnesty provides a fair, earned path to citizenship** that strengthens our economy, unites families, and recognizes the dignity of those who call America home.  

### 📉 **The Failure of Detention and Deportation**  
- **Detention centers waste billions of taxpayer dollars** and fail to solve immigration challenges.  
- **Mass deportations tear families apart** and weaken local economies.  
- **A broken system keeps millions in the shadows**, limiting their ability to work, study, and contribute fully.  

Instead of criminalizing immigrants, we must **integrate them into society through legal pathways and economic opportunity**.
