In today’s world, digital access is more than a convenience—it’s a necessity. From education to job opportunities to civic participation, our ability to thrive often depends on reliable internet and access to technology. Yet, in Georgia’s 5th District, far too many families are left behind by the growing digital divide.

Bridging this divide isn’t just about connecting people to the internet—it’s about ensuring that every person, regardless of income or location, has the tools and opportunities to succeed in the digital age. It’s about leveling the playing field and making sure no one is excluded from the opportunities technology provides.

## The Impact of the Digital Divide

The digital divide in Georgia’s 5th District disproportionately affects low-income families, rural communities, and people of color. The lack of reliable, affordable internet access creates barriers in critical areas:

- **Education**: Students without access to broadband or devices struggle to complete homework, attend virtual classes, or participate in online learning resources. The pandemic highlighted this disparity, leaving many children at a disadvantage.  
- **Job Opportunities**: From applying for jobs to acquiring new skills through online training, digital access is essential for career advancement. Yet, many in our district lack the connectivity needed to seize these opportunities.  
- **Civic Participation**: The internet plays a vital role in staying informed, registering to vote, and engaging with elected officials. Without access, communities are silenced in conversations that shape their futures.  

The digital divide is a systemic barrier that reinforces inequality, making it harder for underserved communities to catch up and thrive.

## A Vision for Digital Equity

Closing the digital divide is about more than providing internet—it’s about creating a foundation for equity and opportunity. Here’s how we can make it happen in Georgia’s 5th District:

### 1. **Expanding Affordable Broadband Access**

Reliable and affordable broadband should be a basic utility, not a luxury. We need to:

- Work with local and federal partners to expand broadband infrastructure to underserved neighborhoods and rural areas.  
- Subsidize internet access for low-income families through programs that ensure no household is left offline.  
- Hold internet service providers accountable for fair pricing and transparent practices.  

Access to broadband is a right, and we must treat it as such.

### 2. **Creating Community Tech Hubs**

Community tech hubs can serve as vital resources for education, training, and innovation. These spaces can:

- Provide free access to computers, high-speed internet, and digital literacy training.  
- Host workshops on coding, resume building, and other skills that empower residents to advance their careers.  
- Serve as gathering places where community members can connect, collaborate, and innovate together.  

By investing in these hubs, we can create spaces that empower people and build stronger, more connected communities.

### 3. **Investing in Digital Literacy Programs**

Digital literacy is as important as access itself. We need to ensure that everyone—from students to seniors—has the skills to navigate the digital world. Programs should focus on:

- Teaching essential skills like using email, online banking, and navigating government services.  
- Offering advanced training in areas like coding, data analysis, and digital marketing to prepare residents for high-demand careers.  
- Partnering with schools and libraries to provide ongoing resources and support.  

When people are equipped with the skills they need, they can take full advantage of the opportunities technology offers.

## Why This Matters

The digital divide isn’t just a tech problem—it’s a justice problem. It’s about ensuring every person in Georgia’s 5th District has the same opportunities to learn, work, and participate in society. It’s about closing gaps that have persisted for too long and creating a future where technology is a bridge, not a barrier.
