Grit isn’t something you’re born with—it’s something you learn through experience, through struggle, and through the examples of the people who come before you. For me, that example was my family. Their grit in the face of adversity shaped not only who I am but also the values I carry with me every day. 

Their Grit taught me to never back down from a challenge and to always fight for what’s right, no matter how steep the climb. It’s this legacy that drives my commitment to fighting for justice, equity, and opportunity for all.

## Lessons of Grit From My Mother

My mother’s story is the cornerstone of my family’s legacy of grit. As an immigrant, she worked tirelessly to build a better life for her children. Balancing multiple jobs, navigating a system that wasn’t built for people like her, and sacrificing so much along the way, she showed me the power of determination.

Her journey to citizenship through the Reagan-era Amnesty program wasn’t just a milestone for her—it was a turning point for our family. It gave us stability, opportunity, and the chance to dream bigger. Her strength in the face of struggle taught me the value of perseverance and the importance of creating systems that offer everyone a fair shot.

## Watching My Sister’s Struggle

Another profound influence on my understanding of Grit came from watching my sister navigate life as a teen mom. At just 17, she faced challenges that could have overwhelmed anyone. Balancing school, work, and raising my niece, she showed me what it means to rise to the occasion, even when the odds are stacked against you.

Her experience also opened my eyes to the systemic barriers young mothers face—the lack of affordable childcare, limited access to education, and the judgment from a society that too often offers criticism instead of support. Her Grit inspired me to fight for policies that uplift families and ensure that no one has to face these challenges alone.

## The Grit of Everyday People

What I’ve learned from my family’s story is that grit isn’t unique to us—it’s a quality shared by millions of families across this country. It’s the single mother working overtime to provide for her kids. It’s the immigrant striving for a better future despite countless obstacles. It’s the student juggling work and school to create a path forward.

This grit is what drives our communities, but it’s not enough on its own. People shouldn’t have to rely solely on Grit to get by. That’s why I’m committed to building systems that don’t just reward grit but actively support it—systems that provide opportunity, stability, and fairness for everyone.

## Fighting for Justice and Equity

My family’s legacy of grit is the foundation of my commitment to justice and equity. It’s why I fight for:

- **Affordable Housing**: Ensuring every family has a safe and stable place to call home.  
- **Universal Healthcare**: Guaranteeing access to quality care for everyone, regardless of income.  
- **Equitable Education**: Providing resources and opportunities that empower all students, no matter their background.  
- **Economic Justice**: Closing wage gaps, creating fair job opportunities, and supporting working families.  

These policies aren’t just abstract goals—they’re solutions rooted in the struggles I’ve seen and the values I hold dear.

## A Legacy That Drives Action

The grit my family showed in overcoming adversity isn’t just a source of pride—it’s a call to action. It reminds me that while Grit is admirable, it shouldn’t be a requirement for survival. Everyone deserves a fair chance, and it’s the responsibility of leaders to create the systems that make that possible.

My leadership is built on this legacy: a deep understanding of the struggles families face, a commitment to addressing systemic barriers, and a determination to fight for justice and equity every step of the way.

## Why It Matters

Grit is what gets us through hard times, but it shouldn’t be the only thing people can rely on. My family’s story is proof of what’s possible when Grit meets opportunity. It’s a reminder of the power of determination, but also of the need for leaders who fight to make opportunity accessible to everyone.

**This is why I fight: to honor the legacy of grit that shaped me, to create systems that uplift every family, and to ensure that justice, equity, and opportunity are within reach for all. Together, we can build a future that reflects the strength of our shared Grit.**
