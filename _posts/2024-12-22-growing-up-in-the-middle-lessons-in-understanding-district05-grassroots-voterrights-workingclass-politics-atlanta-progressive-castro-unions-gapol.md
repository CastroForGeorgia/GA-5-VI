I’ve often felt like I grew up in the middle—between cultures, identities, and ideologies. My family’s roots in Mexico and my wife’s family that spans both feminists and conservative Trump-supporting members created a dynamic, often challenging environment.

This wasn’t a childhood where everything fit neatly into boxes. It was one of constant negotiation, where I had to listen, empathize, and navigate opposing views with care. While this sometimes left me feeling like I didn’t fully belong anywhere, it also gave me a gift: the ability to see the world from many perspectives.

## Living Between Cultures

On one hand, my family’s Mexican heritage was a source of pride, tradition, and community. On the other, I grew up trying to balance this with the experience of living in America—a place that often treated immigrants as outsiders. I gained a deeper understanding of what it means to live on the margins, to fight for recognition, and to find resilience in struggle.

Each of these layers shaped my worldview. They taught me that people’s experiences aren’t simple or singular—they’re shaped by culture, history, and circumstances that run deep.

## Understanding Diverse Perspectives

It wasn’t just cultural divides I had to navigate. My wife’s family added another dimension to my understanding of the world. On one side, there were her feminists relatives and her gay uncles, who taught me about fighting for justice and equality. On the other side were her conservative Trump-supporting family members, who voiced concerns about tradition and stability in a rapidly changing world.

Instead of dismissing these perspectives, I learned to listen. I didn’t always agree, but I tried to understand where they were coming from. I saw their fears, their frustrations, and—most importantly—their humanity.

This practice of listening and empathizing didn’t just help me survive family dinners; it shaped how I approach leadership. I’ve come to believe that the best solutions come from bringing people together, not pushing them apart. It’s about finding common ground without compromising on justice and equity.

## Leadership That Unites

Growing up in the middle taught me that unity doesn’t mean uniformity. It means recognizing our shared humanity while respecting our differences. It means creating spaces where every voice is heard, even when those voices don’t agree.

In a world that often feels divided—by race, by class, by ideology—this perspective is more important than ever. It’s what drives my belief in leadership that prioritizes understanding over blame, dialogue over division, and collaboration over conflict.

## Building Bridges, Not Walls

When I look at the challenges we face as a country—economic inequality, systemic racism, climate change—I see problems that can’t be solved by one group alone. They require all of us to come together, to share our experiences, and to build solutions that work for everyone.

This isn’t easy work. It means sitting in the discomfort of disagreement, hearing out perspectives you might not like, and finding a path forward together. But it’s the only way we’ll build a future where everyone has a place.

## Why This Matters

My experience of growing up in the middle isn’t unique. Millions of people navigate spaces where cultures, identities, and ideologies collide. What I’ve learned from these experiences is that our differences don’t have to divide us—they can make us stronger. 

Leadership isn’t about picking sides. It’s about building bridges. It’s about creating a world where everyone feels seen, heard, and valued. That’s the kind of leadership I believe in, and that’s the kind of leadership I’m committed to bringing to our community and our country.
