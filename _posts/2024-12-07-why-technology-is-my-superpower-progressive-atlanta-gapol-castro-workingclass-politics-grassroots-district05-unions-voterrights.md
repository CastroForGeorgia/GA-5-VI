Technology has always been more than a career for me—it’s been a way to solve problems, connect people, and create opportunities. From the first time I wrote a simple program to my work leading transformative projects, I’ve seen firsthand how technology can be a powerful tool for change. It’s taught me to think critically, act decisively, and always consider the human impact of the systems we build.

My background in engineering is more than just a set of technical skills—it’s my superpower. It’s what equips me to navigate systemic challenges with empathy and precision, bringing a problem-solver’s mindset to the issues that matter most to our communities.

## The Journey from Coder to Leader

When I started my journey in tech, it was all about the thrill of solving problems. Debugging code, optimizing systems, and building tools that made people’s lives easier gave me a sense of purpose and accomplishment. But as I grew in my career, I realized that technology wasn’t just about what you build—it’s about who you build it for.

Leading projects for organizations like the **Baltimore Symphony Orchestra**, the **High Museum of Art**, and the **Seattle Symphony Orchestra** gave me a deep understanding of how technology could serve industries beyond Silicon Valley. I learned how nonprofits and arts organizations navigated limited resources and complex challenges, and I built tools that helped them thrive.

From there, my work expanded to include projects in healthcare and platforms that empower small businesses—industries where the stakes are high, and the impact is immediate. These experiences shaped my approach to leadership, showing me how to design solutions that prioritize people while addressing systemic inefficiencies.

## Applying Tech to Systemic Challenges

Technology isn’t just about writing code—it’s about understanding systems. It’s about identifying what’s broken, listening to the people affected, and building tools that create meaningful change. My engineering background has taught me to:

- **Break Down Complex Problems**: Whether it’s debugging a program or addressing economic inequality, the key is to tackle challenges one step at a time while keeping the bigger picture in mind.  
- **Design Human-Centered Solutions**: Technology is only effective when it serves real people. I approach every challenge by asking how it impacts those who are most vulnerable and how we can make systems more inclusive.  
- **Iterate and Improve**: No solution is perfect on the first try. Just as I refine code, I believe in refining policies and systems based on feedback and real-world results.  

These principles guide how I approach the systemic challenges our communities face today—from housing insecurity to healthcare access to government accountability.

## The Power of Empathy in Technology

While technology gives us incredible tools, it’s empathy that ensures we use them wisely. My work has taught me to look beyond the technical problem and consider the human experience. Whether it’s a family trying to find affordable housing or a small business owner navigating bureaucracy, the goal is always to make systems easier, fairer, and more effective.

This combination of technical expertise and human understanding is what sets technology apart as a tool for empowerment. It’s not just about innovation—it’s about creating solutions that uplift people and build stronger communities.

## Why This Matters

In Congress, I plan to bring this same mindset to leadership. Technology has taught me to think critically, act with precision, and always center the needs of the people I serve. Whether it’s using data to hold politicians accountable, building platforms like the **Mantle Platform** to connect people with resources, or designing policies that address systemic inequities, my goal is to use my superpower for good.

We need leaders who understand how systems work—leaders who don’t just point out what’s broken but have the skills and vision to fix it. That’s what I bring to the table, and that’s why I’m fighting for a future where technology isn’t just a tool for the few but a resource for everyone.

**This is why I fight: to use technology as a force for empowerment, to bring a problem-solver’s mindset to leadership, and to build systems that work for everyone. Together, we can harness the power of innovation to create a better future for all.**
