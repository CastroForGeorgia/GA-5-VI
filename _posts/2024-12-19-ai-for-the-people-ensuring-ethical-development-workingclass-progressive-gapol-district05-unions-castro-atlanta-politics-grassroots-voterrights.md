Artificial intelligence is transforming the way we live and work, with the potential to revolutionize public services, create jobs, and improve everyday life. But if developed irresponsibly, AI can deepen inequalities, displace workers, and erode public trust. That’s why ethical AI development isn’t just a technical concern—it’s a societal one.

I believe AI should work for the people, not against them. By prioritizing ethics, transparency, and equity, we can ensure that AI is a force for good, driving innovation while safeguarding the rights and opportunities of every worker and community member.

## Policies for Ethical AI Development

To ensure AI benefits everyone, my policies focus on three core principles: equity, accountability, and empowerment.

### 1. **Job Creation and Workforce Transition**

AI has the potential to create as many jobs as it displaces—if we make the right investments. My plan includes:

- **Upskilling and Reskilling Programs**: Partnering with educational institutions and tech companies to provide workers with the skills needed for AI-related jobs, from data analysis to machine learning.  
- **Job Creation in Public Services**: Using AI to enhance, not replace, human roles in public sectors like healthcare, education, and infrastructure management. AI tools can streamline operations while creating opportunities for workers to take on higher-value roles.  
- **Fair Workforce Transition**: Establishing programs that provide financial support and retraining for workers whose jobs are impacted by AI.  

By investing in people, we can ensure that AI drives opportunity rather than displacement.

### 2. **AI to Enhance Public Services**

AI has the power to improve public services by making them more efficient, accessible, and responsive. Key initiatives include:

- **Healthcare**: Deploying AI to streamline patient care, reduce wait times, and enhance diagnostics while preserving patient privacy and the essential role of healthcare workers.  
- **Education**: Using AI tools to personalize learning, identify gaps in student achievement, and support teachers in creating inclusive classroom experiences.  
- **Infrastructure**: Applying AI to optimize public transportation, monitor infrastructure health, and allocate resources effectively for public safety and urban planning.  

By prioritizing ethical deployment, we can ensure AI enhances services without compromising human oversight or accountability.

### 3. **Protecting Workers’ Rights**

As AI becomes more integrated into the workplace, it’s critical to safeguard workers’ rights and prevent exploitation. My policies will:

- **Ban Exploitative Surveillance**: Prohibit the use of AI to monitor workers in ways that violate their privacy or wellbeing.  
- **Guarantee Fair Wages**: Ensure that automation doesn’t lead to wage suppression by requiring that companies invest in workforce equity as they adopt AI.  
- **Union Representation in AI Oversight**: Involve workers’ unions in decisions about how AI is implemented in workplaces to ensure it benefits employees rather than eroding their rights.  

Ethical AI must prioritize human dignity and respect for labor.

### 4. **Transparency and Accountability**

To build trust, AI systems must be transparent and accountable. This means:

- **Open Algorithms for Public Services**: Any AI deployed by government agencies must be transparent, with algorithms open for public review to ensure fairness and eliminate bias.  
- **Independent Oversight Bodies**: Establishing independent bodies to monitor AI deployment in critical areas like policing, healthcare, and housing to prevent misuse.  
- **Community Feedback Loops**: Creating mechanisms for citizens to report concerns or biases in AI systems and ensuring these are addressed swiftly.  

Transparency isn’t just about technology—it’s about trust.

### 5. **AI for Small Businesses and Communities**

AI shouldn’t only benefit big corporations. My policies will focus on:

- **Affordable AI Tools**: Providing grants and subsidies to small businesses and nonprofits to help them adopt AI tools that streamline operations and enhance impact.  
- **Community AI Hubs**: Creating spaces where residents can learn about and experiment with AI, fostering innovation and empowerment at the local level.  
- **Open Access to AI Models**: Leveraging platforms like [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/CastroForGeorgia) to provide communities with access to AI models and tools that address local needs.  

By democratizing AI, we ensure it serves everyone.

## Why This Matters

AI is more than a tool—it’s a transformative force that will shape the future of our economy, government, and society. How we develop and deploy AI will determine whether it becomes a source of opportunity or a driver of inequality. My commitment to ethical AI development is about ensuring that this powerful technology benefits the many, not just the few.

**This is why I fight: to harness AI as a tool for empowerment, to protect workers and communities, and to build a future where technology serves the people. Together, we can ensure that AI drives innovation, equity, and progress for all.**
