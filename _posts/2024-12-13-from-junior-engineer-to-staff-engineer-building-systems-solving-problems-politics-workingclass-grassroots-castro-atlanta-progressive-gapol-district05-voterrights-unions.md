Every journey begins with a single step. For me, that step was as a junior engineer, eager to learn, solve problems, and prove myself in a field that demanded precision and innovation. Over the years, I worked my way up to staff engineer, leading projects that weren’t just about technology but about people—improving lives, solving real-world challenges, and delivering results that mattered.

That career taught me more than just how to write code or build systems. It shaped how I approach challenges, how I collaborate, and how I lead. These lessons—earned through years of work—now define my vision for leadership and my approach to serving others.

## Breaking Down Challenges

One of the first things I learned as an engineer was that problems are rarely as simple as they seem. Behind every bug, glitch, or inefficiency is a system—one shaped by decisions, constraints, and human effort. To fix it, you can’t just patch the surface. You have to dig deeper.

When I looked at lines of code, I didn’t just see syntax; I tried to understand the environment that created it. Was this written under a tight deadline? Was it part of a startup sprinting to deliver a product, or a corporate project bogged down by layers of process? This lens of understanding wasn’t about blame—it was about context. And it’s the same lens I bring to leadership.

Whether I’m tackling a technical issue or addressing a systemic challenge in our community, I start by asking questions: Why is this happening? Who is affected? What constraints are shaping the problem? Only then can we craft solutions that don’t just fix what’s broken but make the entire system better.

## Seeking Purpose in My Work

Throughout my career, I’ve sought out opportunities to work on projects that make a difference. I’ve always believed that technology should serve a greater good, and that belief has guided every step of my journey.

Some of the most transformative experiences in my career came through working with nonprofit arts organizations. These included the **[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra](https://www.bsomusic.org/)**, **[High Museum of Art](https://www.high.org/)**, **[Seattle Symphony Orchestra](https://seattlesymphony.org/)**, **[Lyric Opera of Chicago](https://www.lyricopera.org/)**, **[Oregon Shakespeare Festival](https://www.osfashland.org/)**, and the **[Straz Center for the Performing Arts](https://www.strazcenter.org/)**.  

These projects taught me about the unique challenges faced by arts and nonprofit industries. From managing limited budgets to leveraging technology for broader community engagement, I saw firsthand how critical it is to align systems with an organization’s mission. Each of these institutions plays a vital role in enriching their communities, and supporting their goals gave my work a deeper purpose.

These experiences didn’t just make me a better engineer—they deepened my understanding of the arts’ importance in building strong, vibrant communities and the systemic challenges nonprofits face in achieving their missions.

## Uplifting Others and Finding Fulfillment

The real turning point in my career came when I stopped trying to be the one with all the answers. I realized that my time was limited, but my impact could be multiplied if I focused on uplifting those around me.

When I poured my energy into mentoring teammates, sharing knowledge, and creating opportunities for others to grow, I saw something incredible happen. My career didn’t just move forward—it exploded. The more I invested in others, the more fulfilling my work became, and the more successful our teams were. 

This lesson transformed my understanding of leadership. True leadership isn’t about being the star performer—it’s about empowering others to shine. It’s about building systems, teams, and communities where everyone can thrive.

## Delivering Impactful Results

In engineering, it’s not enough to build something—it has to work, and it has to matter. I’ve carried that lesson into every aspect of my life. Whether I’m designing systems or crafting policy, I focus on outcomes that make a tangible difference for people.

When I think about the challenges we face as a community—housing insecurity, healthcare access, economic inequality—I see them as systems in need of redesign. Just as I did in my engineering career, I approach these problems with a focus on impact: crafting solutions that aren’t just bold but practical, actionable, and effective.

## Leadership Built on Understanding and Empowerment

Leadership, to me, isn’t about having all the answers. It’s about asking the right questions, bringing people together, and creating systems that serve everyone. It’s about listening—not just to the loudest voices but to those often left out of the conversation. And it’s about solving problems—not just for today but for the long term.

What fulfills me most isn’t just solving problems—it’s uplifting those around me. That’s what I want to do with my community and my country. I want to empower others to thrive, to grow, and to lead. I believe that when we work together, when we invest in each other, we can accomplish extraordinary things.

The systems we live in—our economy, our healthcare, our education—were built by people. And like any system, they can be rebuilt, redesigned, and improved. With the right leadership, with the right focus, we can solve the problems that hold us back and create a society that works for all of us.
