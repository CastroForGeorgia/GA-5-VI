Leadership isn’t about knowing everything—it’s about understanding the struggles of the people you serve and finding ways to make their lives better. Whether in my engineering career or my work as a community advocate, I’ve learned that true understanding comes from experience: listening to people’s stories, learning from their challenges, and addressing the systems that shape their lives.

My approach to leadership is rooted in this belief. It’s about listening first, learning always, and crafting solutions that meet the needs of real people.

## Understanding Through Lived Experience

Growing up in a working-class family, I saw firsthand how hard it was to make ends meet. I watched my mother juggle multiple jobs, my sister struggle as a teen mom, and my own family navigate a system that often felt stacked against us. These experiences shaped my understanding of the challenges working families face and instilled in me a deep empathy for others going through the same struggles.

This understanding is what drives me to fight for affordable housing, universal healthcare, and equitable education. It’s not just policy to me—it’s personal. I know the stakes because I’ve lived them.

## Lessons From My Career in Engineering

In my engineering career, I learned that solutions are only as good as the understanding behind them. Designing a system that works requires asking the right questions, listening to feedback, and addressing the root causes of the problem. It’s not enough to apply a quick fix—you need to create something sustainable, something that works for the people using it.

This mindset has shaped my approach to leadership. Whether it’s tackling systemic inequality or improving access to public resources, I prioritize understanding the context, listening to those most affected, and building solutions that last.

## Leadership Through Listening

One of the most important lessons I’ve learned is the power of listening. True leadership starts by hearing people’s stories—understanding their struggles, hopes, and needs. When you take the time to listen, you gain the insight needed to create meaningful change.

In my work, this means engaging directly with the people impacted by policies, holding open forums, and fostering an ongoing dialogue. Leadership isn’t about making decisions in isolation—it’s about working together to find the best path forward.

## Addressing Real-World Struggles

Understanding isn’t just about listening—it’s about action. The insights gained through lived experience and community engagement must lead to solutions that address real-world struggles. This is why I focus on policies that tackle the root causes of inequality and create pathways for opportunity:

- **Affordable Housing**: Ensuring every family has a stable, safe place to call home.  
- **Universal Healthcare**: Guaranteeing access to quality care for everyone, regardless of income.  
- **Economic Equity**: Closing wage gaps, expanding job opportunities, and supporting working families.  
- **Educational Access**: Providing resources that empower students and families to succeed.  

Each of these solutions is informed by the experiences of the people they’re meant to serve.

## Building Systems That Work for Everyone

My approach to leadership is grounded in the belief that systems should work for everyone, not just the privileged few. Too often, the people who design policies are disconnected from the realities of the people affected by them. My goal is to bridge that gap—to bring lived experience into the decision-making process and ensure that policies reflect the needs of real people.

Whether through my technical expertise or my advocacy, I’ve seen how understanding systems—and the people within them—can lead to better outcomes. It’s this blend of empathy, expertise, and action that defines my leadership.

## Why Understanding Matters

Understanding is the foundation of effective leadership. Without it, policies fail to address the real needs of the people. But when leaders take the time to listen, to learn, and to act with purpose, they can create systems that uplift everyone.
