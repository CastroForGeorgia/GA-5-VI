## **The Democratic Party Has Lost Its Way—It’s Time to Take It Back**  

The Democratic Party has abandoned its working-class roots, succumbing to corporate influence at the expense of everyday Americans. I’m running for Congress in **Georgia’s 5th District** because I refuse to stand by while our party prioritizes profit over people. We need leadership that fights for economic justice, civil rights, and bold, transformative change—not incrementalism that keeps us struggling.  

## **A Party at a Crossroads**  

Our bills keep rising, healthcare remains unaffordable, and wages don’t keep up—yet too many Democratic leaders accept the status quo. They talk about change but never fight for it. The party must choose: Will it stand with the people or remain a pawn of corporate America?  

## **I Am Not From the Left or the Right—I’m From the Bottom**  

I know what it means to struggle. Unlike politicians who take corporate money and ignore the rest of us, I will **never** accept corporate donations. My loyalty is to the working class—renters, families, and everyone living paycheck to paycheck in **GA-05**.  

## **Choosing a Side**  

Democrats fall into two categories:  

- **Those who see change as essential**—because their survival depends on it.  
- **Those who see it as a nice idea**—supporting it in theory but never feeling its urgency.  

For working people in **GA-05**, incrementalism isn’t an option. Justice and equity can’t be empty slogans. We need action, now.  

## **A Political Multiplier for Change**  

This campaign isn’t just about winning—it’s about building a movement. I will be a **political multiplier**, using technology and grassroots power to make politics more accessible and inclusive. Together, we can create a coalition to hold our leaders accountable and return the Democratic Party to its rightful place: **on the side of the people**.  

## **Time for a Political Revolution**  

The corporate takeover of the Democratic Party has made it disconnected and out of touch. **It’s time to clean house.** We need representatives who are unapologetically loyal to their communities, not corporate donors.  

I’m running in **GA-05** because this fight isn’t about me—it’s about all of us who’ve been ignored for too long. **I will not hold back. I will not be bought.** Join me, and let’s reclaim our party—and our future—together.
