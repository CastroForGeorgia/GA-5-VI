Leadership isn’t about where you start—it’s about the journey that brings you to the moment where you’re ready to serve. My journey has been shaped by personal struggles, professional achievements, and an unwavering commitment to service. It’s a path that’s taught me resilience, empathy, and the importance of standing up for what’s right.

I’m running for Congress because I believe in a future where no one is left behind. I believe in leadership that listens, learns, and acts decisively to create opportunity and justice for all. Most importantly, I’m running to bring a voice for the people who are too often left out of the conversation.

## A Journey Shaped by Struggles and Resilience

Growing up in a working-class family, I experienced the challenges so many Americans face. I watched my mother work multiple jobs to provide for us, my sister navigate the struggles of being a teen mom, and my family wrestle with a system that often felt stacked against us. These experiences gave me a firsthand understanding of the barriers working families face and the grit it takes to overcome them.

But those challenges also taught me something else: the importance of community, resilience, and the need for systems that work for everyone—not just the privileged few.

## Building Solutions Through Experience

My professional journey as an engineer has been about more than solving technical problems—it’s been about understanding people, systems, and the challenges they face. I learned how to listen, how to ask the right questions, and how to design solutions that meet real needs. These lessons have shaped my approach to leadership.

Whether addressing economic inequality, housing insecurity, or systemic injustice, I approach every challenge with the same mindset: listen to the people impacted, understand the root causes, and build solutions that create lasting change.

## A Commitment to Service

Service has always been at the heart of my journey. From advocating for immigrant families to fighting for equitable education and housing, I’ve worked to ensure that every voice is heard and every person has the opportunity to thrive. My commitment to service is grounded in the belief that leadership is about empowering others—not holding power for its own sake.

This commitment is why I’m running for Congress. I believe that real leadership isn’t about talking over people—it’s about creating a platform for them to be heard.

## Bringing a Voice for the Overlooked

Too many people in our communities feel unheard, unseen, and left behind. Whether it’s working families struggling to make ends meet, immigrants navigating an unjust system, or students fighting for a fair shot at success, their voices are too often ignored by those in power. I’m running to change that.

A people-centered campaign means putting those voices at the forefront. It means listening to the needs of our community and translating those needs into bold, actionable policies that uplift everyone.

## My Vision for Leadership

I believe in leadership that:

- **Listens First**: Engaging directly with the people impacted by decisions to ensure their needs shape the policies we create.  
- **Acts Boldly**: Fighting for transformative solutions, from universal healthcare to affordable housing, that address systemic barriers and create opportunity for all.  
- **Builds Coalitions**: Bringing people together across differences to create solutions that reflect our shared humanity.  

My vision for leadership is rooted in experience and action. It’s about creating systems that reflect the values of equity, justice, and opportunity for everyone.

## Why This Matters

We’re at a pivotal moment. The challenges we face—economic inequality, climate change, systemic injustice—require leaders who are ready to act boldly and decisively. My journey has prepared me to be that leader, and I’m ready to bring my experience, my values, and my commitment to service to Congress.
