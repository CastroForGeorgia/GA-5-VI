When I began my career as an engineer, I thought the job was all about solving technical problems—writing code, debugging systems, and making things work. But as I grew in my career, I realized that engineering isn’t just about technology. It’s about people. It’s about understanding the systems we build, the context in which they operate, and the human challenges they aim to solve.

Those lessons didn’t just make me a better engineer—they shaped my approach to leadership. Today, I carry those principles into my work as an advocate and leader, tackling the challenges facing our communities with the same mindset I brought to solving complex systems: with empathy, curiosity, and a commitment to finding solutions that work for everyone.

## Understanding Systems Through People

One of the most important lessons I learned as an engineer is that every system reflects the people who built it. Behind every piece of code, there’s a story: of tight deadlines, limited resources, or creative problem-solving. Before you can fix a broken system, you have to understand the context that created it.

The same is true for the challenges our communities face. Whether it’s economic inequality, housing insecurity, or gaps in healthcare, these issues don’t exist in a vacuum. They’re the result of systems shaped by policies, histories, and human decisions. To create meaningful change, we have to understand the root causes and address them with solutions that reflect the realities of people’s lives.

## Learning by Doing

Engineering taught me the power of learning by doing—of diving into challenges, experimenting with solutions, and refining them over time. Leadership requires the same approach. You don’t start with all the answers; you start with the willingness to listen, to learn, and to act.

In my career, I learned to listen to teammates, to customers, and to the people affected by the systems I built. Those insights shaped better outcomes, and they taught me that the best solutions come from collaboration. Today, I bring that same commitment to listening and collaboration to my work in public life, ensuring that the voices of those impacted by decisions are at the center of the solutions.

## Balancing the Technical and the Human

One of the most rewarding aspects of my engineering career was balancing technical challenges with human needs. It wasn’t enough to build a system that worked—it had to work for people. Whether it was designing user-friendly interfaces or ensuring that systems were accessible and inclusive, I learned that the best solutions prioritize the needs of the people they serve.

This principle guides my leadership today. When addressing complex issues like affordable housing or healthcare access, I focus on solutions that don’t just look good on paper but make a real difference in people’s lives. It’s not about one-size-fits-all fixes—it’s about understanding the nuances and creating systems that uplift everyone.

## Leadership Rooted in Problem-Solving

Leadership, like engineering, is about solving problems. But it’s also about seeing possibilities. It’s about looking at what’s broken and asking, “How can we make this better?” It’s about recognizing the potential for change and taking the steps to make it happen.

Throughout my career, I’ve learned that progress doesn’t come from perfect plans—it comes from action, iteration, and persistence. It’s a mindset I carry into my advocacy and leadership, always looking for ways to improve the systems that shape our communities.

## Why It Matters

The lessons I’ve learned from my career—about people, systems, and the power of problem-solving—are the foundation of my leadership. They remind me that no challenge is too big when we approach it with empathy, collaboration, and a commitment to finding solutions that work for everyone.

Our communities face complex challenges, but they also hold incredible potential. By applying the principles I’ve learned—listening to people, understanding systems, and acting boldly—we can create a future where every person has the opportunity to thrive.
