Growing up, I learned early on what it meant to face challenges. My family’s economic struggles shaped every aspect of our lives, from the jobs we worked to the dreams we dared to pursue. It wasn’t easy, but those experiences instilled in me something invaluable: grit.

Grit isn’t just perseverance—it’s a deep-seated determination to keep going, even when the odds seem impossible. It’s what got me through the toughest times, and it’s what drives me today to fight for policies that uplift working families and create a fairer, more equitable society.

## Learning Grit Through Experience

As a child, I saw my mother work multiple jobs to keep a roof over our heads. We couldn’t afford babysitters, after-school programs, or the little luxuries that many families take for granted. I remember the pressure of trying to help while still being just a kid myself, and the shame I felt when poverty made me feel different from my peers.

Then, when my sister got pregnant at 17, I witnessed another layer of struggle. She worked tirelessly to provide for my niece, often sacrificing her own dreams to make sure her daughter had what she needed. Watching her juggle school, work, and the overwhelming responsibility of being a young mother opened my eyes to how much harder life can be for those who don’t have the support they deserve.

Her journey showed me the gaps in our systems—the lack of affordable childcare, the barriers to education, and the judgment society places on young mothers instead of offering help. It also taught me the strength of perseverance and love. My sister’s grit and determination became a powerful example of resilience, but it also made me realize how much our society needs to do to support families like hers.

## Fighting for Working Families

My family’s story isn’t unique. Millions of families face the same struggles: deciding between paying the rent or putting food on the table, working long hours for wages that don’t stretch far enough, and trying to provide opportunities for their kids while balancing the weight of daily survival.

These experiences are why I fight for policies that prioritize working families, like:

- **Affordable Housing**: Ensuring that every family has a safe, stable place to live.  
- **Universal Healthcare**: Making healthcare accessible to everyone, regardless of income.  
- **Fair Wages**: Fighting for a living wage that reflects the dignity and value of hard work.  
- **Childcare and Education Support**: Providing resources that help families thrive, from affordable childcare to quality public education.

Grit isn’t just about pushing through struggles—it’s about using those struggles to create change. It’s about ensuring that no family has to face the same impossible choices mine did or that my sister did.

## Turning Grit Into Action

The grit I developed growing up isn’t just a personal trait—it’s a tool I use to drive action. It’s what keeps me focused when challenges seem insurmountable and what pushes me to find solutions even when the path forward isn’t clear.

But grit doesn’t mean going it alone. It means working together, building coalitions, and listening to the voices of those who are often left out of the conversation. It means fighting for systemic change so that families don’t have to rely on resilience alone to make it through.

## Why Grit Matters

Grit matters because it’s what allows us to turn struggle into strength and adversity into opportunity. It’s what fuels the fight for a better future and what keeps us going when progress feels slow. But more than that, grit reminds us that no challenge is too great when we work together, support one another, and refuse to give up.

For me, grit isn’t just about overcoming challenges—it’s about advocating for change. It’s about taking the lessons of my life and using them to fight for a world where every family has a fair shot at success. It’s about building a society where determination and hard work are met with opportunity, not barriers.
