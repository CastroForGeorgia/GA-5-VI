For me, immigration is more than a policy debate—it’s a deeply personal story. It’s the story of my mother, a courageous woman who risked everything to give her family a better life. Her journey didn’t just change her life; it changed mine. It gave me the opportunities that have shaped who I am today and fuels my fight for policies that honor the dignity of immigrants and uplift working families.

## A Leap of Faith

My mother came to this country with nothing but grit and a dream. Like millions of undocumented immigrants, she faced the daily challenges of living in the shadows—working tirelessly, sacrificing endlessly, and enduring the uncertainty of what tomorrow might bring. Despite these hardships, she never lost sight of her goal: to create a better future for her family.

Her determination paid off, when the Reagan-era Amnesty program gave her a chance to step out of the shadows and onto a path to citizenship. That moment was a turning point—not just for her but for our entire family.

## The Power of Opportunity

With legal status, my mother’s life changed almost overnight. She no longer had to live in fear of being separated from her children. She was able to buy her first home, providing us with the stability and security we’d never had before. She could pursue better opportunities, and for the first time, dream about a future not defined by survival but by growth and possibility.

Her journey is proof that when we give people a chance—when we create pathways to legal status and citizenship—we unlock their potential to contribute, to thrive, and to build a better future for themselves and their communities.

## The Legacy of Her Determination

My mother’s story isn’t just a testament to her grit; it’s a reminder of the power of humane immigration policies. Without Amnesty, her story—and mine—might have turned out very differently. I wouldn’t have had the chance to pursue an education, to grow into a career that I love, or to stand here today, running for Congress to fight for families like ours.

Her determination inspires me every day. It’s why I’m committed to policies that reflect the values of compassion, opportunity, and justice. It’s why I fight for an immigration system that prioritizes family unity, provides pathways to citizenship, and rejects the inhumanity of detention camps and mass deportations.

## Why I Fight for Immigration Reform

We can’t ignore the realities facing millions of undocumented immigrants in our country today. Like my mother, these individuals work hard, pay taxes, and contribute to our communities. But too many live in fear, caught in a system that punishes rather than uplifts.

I believe we need bold, humane immigration reform that puts people first. Here’s what I’m fighting for:

- **Amnesty Programs**: Just as my mother’s life was transformed, so too can the lives of millions of undocumented immigrants today. A clear, fair pathway to citizenship is the right thing to do for families and for our nation.
- **Family Unity**: No family should have to live in fear of being separated. Policies must prioritize keeping loved ones together.
- **Economic Opportunity**: Integrating immigrants into our economy benefits everyone. It strengthens our workforce, drives innovation, and builds thriving communities.
- **An End to Detention Camps**: We must replace punitive systems with humane, community-based solutions that respect the dignity of all individuals.

## A Future Built on Compassion

My mother’s journey taught me that when we invest in people, we all win. Her story is a testament to the power of policies rooted in compassion and opportunity. It’s a reminder that behind every statistic is a family, a dream, and a future waiting to be built.

As I fight for policies that uplift families and honor immigrants, I carry her determination with me. I carry her hope for a better future. And I carry the belief that together, we can create a nation where everyone has the chance to thrive.

**This is why I fight. This is why I’m running. And this is the vision I’m committed to delivering—for families like mine and for the future we all deserve.**
