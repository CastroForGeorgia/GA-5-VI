title: "What Coding Taught Me About People and Systems"

When I first started coding, I thought it was all about writing perfect lines of logic—systems that worked exactly as intended with no bugs, no hiccups, and no errors. But as I gained more experience, I realized that coding isn’t just about the code. It’s about people—their ideas, their struggles, and the context in which the work is done.

As an engineer, I’ve learned to approach broken systems with empathy, not blame. I’ve learned that before you can fix anything, you have to understand why it’s broken—what pressures shaped it, what constraints existed, and what challenges the person before you was trying to solve. These lessons go far beyond coding; they shape how I approach problems in society, from economic inequality to systemic injustice.

## The Story Behind the Code

Every line of code tells a story. Sometimes it’s a story of tight deadlines, where shortcuts were taken to ship a product on time. Sometimes it’s a story of a team struggling with limited resources, doing their best to meet impossible expectations. And sometimes it’s a story of a person learning as they go, trying their hardest to solve a problem with the tools they have.

When you inherit someone else’s code, it’s easy to criticize—to point out what’s wrong, what’s inefficient, and what doesn’t work. But real progress comes when you approach it with empathy. Why was it written this way? What challenges did they face? What can we learn from their approach, even if it wasn’t perfect?

This mindset doesn’t just make you a better engineer—it makes you a better leader.

## Systems Reflect People

What I’ve learned from coding is that systems—whether they’re technical, social, or economic—aren’t inherently broken. They reflect the people who built them, the constraints they faced, and the values they prioritized. When a system doesn’t work for everyone, it’s not because the people who built it were inherently bad. It’s because they were working within limitations, or they didn’t anticipate every outcome.

This perspective shapes how I tackle societal issues. Instead of placing blame, I ask questions: What created this outcome? Who benefits from the system as it is, and who’s being left behind? What changes can we make to ensure it serves everyone, not just a select few?

## Empathy Drives Solutions

Approaching problems with empathy doesn’t mean excusing harm or ignoring injustices. It means understanding the root causes so you can create lasting solutions. It means recognizing that people—whether they’re writing code or making policies—are shaped by the systems they’re part of.

For example, when we look at economic inequality, it’s easy to blame individuals for their circumstances. But if we dig deeper, we see a system that rewards the wealthy while punishing the poor, that makes it harder for working families to get ahead, and that perpetuates cycles of poverty. The solution isn’t to blame—it’s to rebuild the system.

## Fixing Broken Systems

As an engineer, I know that fixing a broken system takes time, patience, and collaboration. You don’t just patch the surface; you dig into the root cause and make changes that ensure the problem doesn’t happen again. The same is true for societal issues.

Whether it’s healthcare, housing, or education, the systems we rely on were built by people—and they can be rebuilt by people. But it takes leadership that’s willing to ask tough questions, listen to the voices of those impacted, and create solutions that address the real problems.

## The Power of Understanding

What coding has taught me is that every problem, no matter how complex, has a solution. But finding that solution requires understanding—of the people involved, the context in which the system was built, and the constraints that shaped it. It requires empathy, persistence, and a willingness to challenge the status quo.

This is the approach I bring to leadership: tackling issues not with blame, but with understanding; not with shortcuts, but with real, lasting solutions. It’s about fixing what’s broken and building systems that serve everyone.

**This is why I fight: to approach challenges with empathy, to rebuild broken systems, and to create a future where every person has the opportunity to thrive. Together, we can fix what’s broken—and build something better.**
