Technology is often celebrated for its ability to innovate, disrupt, and revolutionize—but at its core, it’s about people. It’s about how the tools we build shape lives, create opportunities, and solve problems. This human context is too often overlooked in conversations about technology, yet it’s the most important part of the equation.

My philosophy on technology is simple: it’s not just about what we create, but who we create it for and how it impacts their lives. This perspective has shaped my career as an engineer, my work as an advocate, and my vision for leadership. By focusing on the human side of technology, I aim to build systems and policies that truly serve the people they’re meant to help.

## Understanding the Human Context

Every system, no matter how advanced or innovative, reflects the people who designed it and the context in which it was built. Throughout my career, I’ve learned that:

- **Behind Every Problem is a Person**: Whether it’s a student struggling to access online resources or a small business navigating bureaucracy, the challenges we solve with technology are deeply personal.  
- **Innovation Isn’t Neutral**: Technology has the power to uplift or exclude. Without considering equity and inclusion, we risk perpetuating the very barriers we aim to break down.  
- **Empathy Drives Better Solutions**: The best systems are built with a deep understanding of the people they serve, from their needs to their fears to their aspirations.  

These lessons remind me that technology is never just about efficiency—it’s about humanity.

## Bringing This Perspective to Policy

As I transition from engineering to public leadership, I bring this human-centered philosophy with me. Here’s how it shapes my approach to policy:

- **Focusing on Impact Over Headlines**: It’s easy to chase flashy ideas, but real progress comes from understanding what people need. Whether it’s expanding broadband access or streamlining government services, I prioritize solutions that create meaningful change.  
- **Centering Equity in Innovation**: From housing to healthcare to education, every policy I advocate for is designed to close gaps, remove barriers, and ensure technology works for everyone—not just the privileged few.  
- **Listening to Constituents**: Just as I listened to users when building systems, I’m committed to listening to the people I serve. Their stories, struggles, and ideas are the foundation of effective leadership.  

By keeping the human context at the forefront, we can ensure that our policies don’t just work—they work for everyone.

## Connecting Technology to Constituents

The human side of technology isn’t just a philosophy—it’s a way to connect with people. Whether I’m explaining how the **Mantle Platform** simplifies access to vital resources or discussing the role of AI in transparency, my goal is to show how technology can make a tangible difference in people’s lives.

For example:

- **Transparency Tools**: AI-driven platforms that analyze voting records and funding sources make government more accountable and accessible to everyday citizens.  
- **Community Resources**: Applications that connect families to housing, healthcare, and legal aid simplify complex systems and empower communities.  
- **Digital Equity Initiatives**: Expanding broadband and creating tech hubs ensure that no one is left behind in the digital age.  

These aren’t just abstract ideas—they’re real solutions that reflect the needs of our district.

## Why This Matters

Technology is more than code, machines, or algorithms—it’s about people. It’s about creating systems that reflect our values of equity, inclusion, and opportunity. By focusing on the human side of technology, we can ensure that innovation serves as a bridge to a better future, not a barrier to progress.

**This is why I fight: to build systems and policies that prioritize people, to connect technology with real-world impact, and to ensure that innovation uplifts everyone. Together, we can harness the human side of technology to create a more just and equitable future.**
