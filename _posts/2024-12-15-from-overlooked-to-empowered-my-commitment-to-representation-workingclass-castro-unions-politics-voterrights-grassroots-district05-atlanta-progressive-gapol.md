Growing up, I often felt like my voice didn’t matter. Whether it was because of my quiet nature, my family’s economic struggles, or the systemic barriers that seemed insurmountable, there were times when I felt invisible—overlooked by the systems and people who were supposed to help. 

That experience shaped me. It taught me how it feels to be unheard, how isolating it can be to feel like your struggles don’t matter to those in power. But it also gave me a mission: to ensure no one feels that way again. It’s why I’m committed to leadership that reflects the people it serves, and to making sure everyone—especially the overlooked—has a voice in the decisions that shape their lives.

## The Pain of Being Overlooked

As a kid, I was the quiet one in the room—the one more likely to observe than to speak up. Add to that the challenges of growing up in a working-class family, where survival often took precedence over dreams, and it’s easy to see why I felt overlooked.

I saw how the systems around us often ignored families like mine. From education to healthcare to housing, it felt like the rules were written for someone else—someone with more resources, more connections, or more power. That sense of exclusion left a mark, but it also fueled a fire in me to ensure others wouldn’t face the same struggles.

## Technology Gave Me a Voice

As I grew older, I found that technology offered a path to reclaiming my voice. It didn’t just allow me to participate—it gave me the tools to build systems that could empower others. My career as an engineer gave me a unique perspective and power: I understand how systems work, and I have the skills to design them myself.

Technology became a way for me to connect with others who felt overlooked, to amplify their voices, and to create platforms that prioritize inclusion and accessibility. This ability to build systems—not just criticize them—has shaped my approach to leadership. I’m not content to identify what’s wrong; I want to fix it and ensure it works for everyone.

## Turning Pain Into Purpose

What I realized as I grew older was that the problem wasn’t with me or families like mine—it was with the systems that failed to include us. Leadership that doesn’t reflect the people it serves will always leave someone behind. That realization became the foundation of my commitment to representation.

I began advocating not just for myself, but for others who felt unheard. I spoke out about the gaps in our systems, the policies that favored the wealthy over the working class, and the need for leaders who truly understand the struggles of everyday people. Slowly but surely, I found my voice—and with it, a purpose.

## Representation That Reflects Us All

True representation means more than diversity on paper—it means leadership that listens, that values lived experience, and that fights for policies grounded in empathy and equity. For me, that means:

- **Elevating Overlooked Voices**: Ensuring that those most affected by policy decisions—working families, immigrants, marginalized communities—have a seat at the table and a platform to share their experiences.  
- **Harnessing Technology for Inclusion**: Using my technical expertise to design systems and tools that amplify voices, foster transparency, and make government accessible to everyone.  
- **Fighting for Equity**: Advocating for policies that close gaps and remove barriers, from affordable housing to universal healthcare to equitable education.  
- **Building Inclusive Systems**: Creating spaces where everyone, regardless of their background, feels empowered to participate in shaping their communities and futures.  

Representation isn’t just about being heard—it’s about being seen, valued, and included in every step of the decision-making process.

## Leadership Rooted in Service

My commitment to representation goes beyond policy—it’s about how I lead. It’s about showing up for the people who feel left behind, listening to their needs, and turning those conversations into action. It’s about leading with empathy and ensuring that every decision I make reflects the voices of the people I serve.

I believe leadership should be a mirror of the community it represents. When leadership reflects the struggles, hopes, and dreams of the people, it creates systems that work for everyone—not just the privileged few.

## Why Representation Matters

Representation isn’t just a principle—it’s a necessity. Without it, our systems will continue to overlook the very people they’re supposed to serve. But when we center the voices of the overlooked and use tools like technology to amplify those voices, we build stronger, more equitable systems. Technology has given me the ability not just to understand these systems, but to rebuild them to work for everyone.

**This is why I fight: to turn pain into purpose, to ensure leadership reflects the people it serves, and to use technology to empower every voice in the decisions that shape our lives. Together, we can create a future where no one is overlooked, and everyone has the opportunity to thrive.**
