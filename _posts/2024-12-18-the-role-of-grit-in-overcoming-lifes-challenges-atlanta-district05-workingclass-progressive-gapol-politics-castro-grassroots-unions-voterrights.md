Life doesn’t always hand us the tools we need to succeed. Sometimes, we have to build those tools ourselves. For me, growing up without a father and facing economic struggles taught me one of the most important lessons in life: grit.

But it wasn’t always a source of pride. Early on, I was so ashamed of being poor that I tried to hide parts of myself out of fear of being judged. I saw my mother working multiple jobs just to keep us afloat, and I felt helpless knowing I couldn’t do more to ease her burden. We couldn’t afford babysitters, so I stayed home to look after my little brother instead of participating in after-school activities. Daycare and extracurriculars were luxuries we simply couldn’t afford.

## Hiding Out of Fear

As a child, poverty often feels like a weight you can’t escape. It’s isolating. I remember making excuses for why I couldn’t join friends at events or participate in school programs, when the truth was we just couldn’t afford it. I felt like I had to keep my struggles hidden, as if being honest about them would make me less worthy in the eyes of others.

But those struggles also planted a seed. I saw how hard my mom worked—how she never stopped, even when it seemed like the odds were stacked against her. I didn’t understand it fully at the time, but her resilience became my foundation.

## Finding Strength in Struggle

Over time, I began to see our hardships differently. Yes, we were poor, and yes, it was difficult. But those experiences gave me a perspective and determination that I carry with me to this day. They taught me to empathize with others who feel unseen or unsupported, and they fueled my desire to create systems that don’t leave people behind.

I came to understand that poverty wasn’t something to be ashamed of—it was something to fight against. And that fight didn’t start with blaming individuals for their circumstances but with recognizing the systems that make it so hard for working families to get ahead.

## Fighting for Working Families

My family’s story isn’t unique. Millions of families face the same impossible choices every day: whether to pay for childcare or put food on the table, whether to work another shift or spend time with their kids. These aren’t choices anyone should have to make.

That’s why I fight for policies that uplift working families—because I’ve lived those struggles, and I know how much they shape your life. From affordable childcare to universal after-school programs, I’m committed to building a future where no child has to feel left out because their family can’t afford opportunities, and no parent has to work multiple jobs just to scrape by.

## Grit as a Guiding Principle

Grit isn’t just about working hard—it’s about persevering even when the odds seem impossible. It’s about taking the lessons from your struggles and using them to create change. That’s the kind of grit I bring to leadership: the determination to fight for equity, the empathy to understand others’ struggles, and the resolve to build systems that truly serve everyone.

## Building Systems That Work for Everyone

Our systems weren’t built to support families like mine growing up. Too often, they favor the wealthy and powerful while leaving working families behind. But I believe we can rebuild these systems to create a fairer, more compassionate society—one where every family has a chance to thrive.

That means fighting for affordable childcare, accessible healthcare, fair wages, and equitable education. It means ensuring that no family is forced to choose between work and their children, and no child is denied opportunities because of their zip code.

## Why Grit Matters

Grit isn’t just a personal trait—it’s a tool for creating change. It’s what allows us to push forward, to rise above challenges, and to build a future that works for everyone. My life has shown me the power of perseverance, and it’s that same perseverance that fuels my fight for our community.
