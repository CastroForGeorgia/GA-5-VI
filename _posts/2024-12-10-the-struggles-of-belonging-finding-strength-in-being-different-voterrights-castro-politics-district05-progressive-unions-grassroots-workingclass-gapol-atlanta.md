I didn’t always feel like I belonged. As a quiet, nerdy kid, I often found myself sitting on the sidelines, feeling misunderstood and out of place. While others seemed to fit into groups effortlessly, I wrestled with the question of where I belonged—or if I even did.

Those struggles weren’t easy. But looking back, I see how much they shaped me—not just as a person, but as a leader. They gave me the grit to keep moving forward, the empathy to connect with others who feel unseen, and the determination to fight for equity and inclusion.

## The Challenge of Being Different

Growing up, I was the kid who loved to read, to learn, to ask questions that others found boring or strange. I wasn’t the loudest in the room or the most popular. I preferred exploring ideas and tinkering with projects over fitting into social molds. And while that curiosity brought me joy, it also made me feel isolated.

Feeling different isn’t easy. It comes with moments of self-doubt, of wondering why you can’t just “be like everyone else.” But it also opens your eyes to the struggles of others who feel left out, overlooked, or dismissed.

## Finding Strength in Struggles

Over time, I began to see my differences not as weaknesses, but as strengths. Being quiet taught me to listen. Feeling misunderstood gave me the drive to connect with others who felt the same way. And struggling to belong helped me understand how powerful it is to create spaces where people feel valued, no matter who they are.

These experiences didn’t just shape how I see the world—they shaped how I lead. They taught me that true strength isn’t about fitting in; it’s about embracing what makes you unique and using that to uplift others.

## A Fight for Inclusion

As I’ve grown, I’ve carried these lessons with me. I see the pain that comes from being excluded or overlooked, and I know how important it is to build systems and communities where everyone feels they have a place.

That’s why I fight for equity and inclusion—not just as ideals, but as actions. It’s why I believe in leadership that prioritizes listening to the voices of those who are often silenced, and creating opportunities for those who are often left behind.

## Building a Better Future

The struggles I faced as a kid taught me the power of grit, empathy, and connection. They showed me that being different isn’t something to hide—it’s something to celebrate. And they gave me the perspective to lead with compassion and a commitment to building a future where everyone belongs.

If you’ve ever felt out of place, I want you to know: I see you. I understand your struggles, and I carry those lessons with me every day. Together, we can create a world where no one feels left out or unseen—a world where our differences make us stronger.
