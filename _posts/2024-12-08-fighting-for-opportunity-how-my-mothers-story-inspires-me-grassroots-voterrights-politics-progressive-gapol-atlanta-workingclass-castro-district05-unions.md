When I think about the power of opportunity, I think of my mother. Her journey to citizenship wasn’t easy—it was a story of grit, determination, and faith in a better future. Watching her navigate the challenges of being an immigrant while raising a family taught me lessons I carry with me every day. Her story is a testament to how transformative opportunity can be when it’s paired with hard work and hope.

Her determination didn’t just shape my life—it inspires my fight for policies that honor immigrant families, promote equity, and create pathways for success for everyone.

## My Mother’s Journey

My mother immigrated to the United States with nothing but her grit and a dream. She worked tirelessly, often taking on multiple jobs just to keep our family afloat. For years, she lived in the shadows, like so many undocumented immigrants who contribute so much to our communities but are denied basic recognition and rights.

Everything changed for her—and for us—when she had the chance to apply for citizenship through the Reagan-era Amnesty program. That opportunity gave her the stability to buy her first home, to provide more for her children, and to dream beyond survival. Her life transformed, and with it, so did ours.

## The Transformative Power of Opportunity

My mother’s story taught me that opportunity isn’t just about individual success—it’s about the ripple effects it creates for families and communities. When we invest in people, when we give them the tools and resources they need to thrive, the results are extraordinary.

But opportunity shouldn’t be a matter of luck or timing. It should be a guarantee—a promise that everyone, regardless of where they come from, has a fair shot at building a better life. That’s why I fight for policies that ensure opportunity isn’t reserved for the few but available to all.

## Fighting for Immigrant Families

My mother’s journey showed me the struggles immigrant families face and the immense contributions they make to our society. Yet, too often, our policies fail to reflect their humanity. That’s why I’m committed to:

- **Pathways to Citizenship**: Advocating for legislation that provides undocumented immigrants with a clear, fair, and accessible pathway to legal status.  
- **Family Unity**: Prioritizing policies that keep families together and end practices like detention and deportation that tear loved ones apart.  
- **Economic Equity**: Creating opportunities for immigrants to access education, job training, and small business resources to help them succeed and contribute to our communities.  
- **Protection and Dignity**: Ensuring that no one is forced to live in fear by ending exploitative practices and promoting humane immigration reform.

## Promoting Equity and Pathways for Success

The lessons I learned from my mother’s story go beyond immigration. They remind me of the importance of creating systems that uplift everyone, not just those who are already at the top. From affordable housing to universal healthcare to equitable education, every policy I fight for is rooted in the belief that opportunity should be universal.

Opportunity is transformative, but it requires investment. It requires leaders who are willing to act boldly to remove barriers, close gaps, and build pathways that allow people to thrive.

## Why It Matters

My mother’s story is one of millions. It’s a reminder that behind every struggle is a family striving for something better, and behind every opportunity is the potential to change lives. Her determination inspires me to fight for a future where no one is left behind—a future where opportunity isn’t just a dream but a reality for all.

**This is why I fight: to honor stories like my mother’s, to create policies that uplift immigrant families, and to build a future where opportunity belongs to everyone. Together, we can ensure that every family has the chance to thrive.**
