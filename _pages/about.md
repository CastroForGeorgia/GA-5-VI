# About Andres Castro

Hi, I’m **Andres Castro**, a software engineer and working-class leader running for Congress in **Georgia’s 5th District**. My journey began as the son of a courageous immigrant from Acapulco, Mexico, who moved us to Georgia to escape abuse and poverty. Growing up in **Marietta and Powder Springs**, I experienced the challenges of poverty, racism, and systemic barriers firsthand.

Through grit and determination, I earned a degree in **Computer Science** from Kennesaw State University, launched a successful engineering career, and became a proud homeowner in **Oakland City, Atlanta**. My experiences taught me that systemic change is needed to ensure no one is left behind.

I’m running for Congress to fight for:  
- **Economic Justice**: A fair economy with living wages, strong unions, and housing affordability.  
- **Universal Healthcare**: Medicare for All to guarantee quality care for every resident.  
- **Civil Rights**: Equality and protections for all, including marginalized and LGBTQ+ communities.  
- **Open Government**: Transparency and accountability, giving power back to the people.  
- **Technology for Good**: Policies that ensure innovation serves humanity, not corporate greed.  

This campaign is about **you**, your family, and building a future where everyone can thrive.
