# About Me

**I’m Andres Castro—a working-class leader, software engineer, and community advocate running for Congress in Georgia’s 5th District. My core mission is to fight for economic justice, Medicare for All, and civil rights, ensuring that working families have a real voice in Washington.**

I know firsthand what it’s like to struggle. Growing up in **Marietta and Powder Springs** with an immigrant mother from **Acapulco, Mexico**, I faced poverty, racism, and systemic barriers. Determination carried me through **Kennesaw State University**, where I earned a **Computer Science degree** while juggling jobs to pay the bills. Today, I’m proud to be a **homeowner in Oakland City, Atlanta**, a testament to the resilience of working people everywhere.

But no accomplishment matters without the people we love. **My wife**, a committed feminist advocate, has taught me the value of standing firm—even when facing political divides. Her parents and I don’t always see eye to eye politically, but we share a deep commitment to strong family ties and hard work. **My younger brother**, who is finishing his last year of service in the Coast Guard, and **my older sister**, a small business owner now helping me campaign, remind me every day why we need a government that respects and rewards hard work. And **my niece**, on the verge of graduating from **Georgia State University** with a game design degree, shows the promise that comes when we invest in young people’s futures.

Keeping family close has always been one of my greatest priorities—so much so that I was fortunate enough to buy **two side-by-side homes** for us. Now, I’m running for Congress to make sure families across our district have the same opportunity to thrive, no matter their background.
